# Moonwalk All Star

We were invited to hack a Converse, so we made a shoe that detects when you moonwalk.

Technology:
(1) Arduino UNO
(1) MPU-6050 Sensor - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11028

Code:
All the nessecary parts are included but in case you need a more current version, the Arduino code is from Jeff Rowberg's
i2cdevlib library.  https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino/MPU6050

Enjoy!
